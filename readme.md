## About Math Team Trainer

Math Team Trainer was created as a prototype online platform to help high school students prepare for regional competitions. Users can track their progress, contribute to discussions about individual problems, and compete for top spots on the leaderboard

Current problem categories include algebra, geometry, ratio and proportion, sequences and series, and trignometry. All problems are sourced from past AMC 10/12 contests, the Massachusetts Association of Math Leagues, the Maine Association of Math Leagues, and the Intermediate Math League of Eastern Massachusetts. 

I do not plan to continue work on this project at this time.
